Library Management System is a Java Standalone application for managing simple tasks in a library.

## Objective

The main task of the whole system is to handle the tasks of a regular library easily registering members, borrowing books, â€¦.. Etc. The system was designed so that each one of the employees and members will be able to do his work smoothly by using a computer system instead of using papers and making things in the old way.


## The system is designed based on three main modules

1- OOP to write the execution of different tasks. 
2- JavaFX for user interface 
3- Apache Derby for the database
